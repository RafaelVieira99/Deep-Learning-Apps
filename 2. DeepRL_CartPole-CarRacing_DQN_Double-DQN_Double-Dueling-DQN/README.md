This project involved two environments:
CartPole
CarRacing
Where different Neural Network architectures have been implemented:
DQN
Double DQN
Dueling DQN
Double Dueling DQN
In an attempt to choose the best one that applies to each environment, considering several parameters.
The report and the video are in Portuguese, as this was part of a college project
